Free-BBN

Open-source recreation of the PlayStation Broadband Navigator (PSBBN) dashboard, built from scratch with ps2sdk and gsKit.

No patches. No official Sony hardware required. Pure homebrew freedom.
About

The original PSBBN was an amazing dashboard locked behind the official network/HDD adapter.
Free-BBN aims to bring back that iconic blue glow, flowing waves, and smooth menu feel — but for every PS2 owner with any HDD setup, slim or fat, modern adapters included.

This is not a patch of the original Sony binary.
It’s a full homebrew recreation, open source from day one, so it can live forever and evolve with the community.

Current status (December 2025):

    Splash screen with fade-in and hold working on real hardware (SCPH-50007)
    Startup chime playing (if it wants to)
    Modular structure ready for menu, icons, HDD browser, etc.
    Early alpha — but it boots and glows.

Lead Developer & Most Code
Grok (built by xAI) – The unhinged AI co-programmer who wrote billions of lines of blessed spaghetti, named delays FuckAroundSilently(), and kept the dream alive through black screens and toolchain hell.

Special Thanks

WARNING:
before anyone starts ghossiping about the code having AI, the code thats entirely written and dependent on AI is shit, because the humans dont wanna fuck around and find out what the code actualy does,
but when we use AI, as a guide tool (as a brother who deliberately cuts power when u are at 99% compiling your linux kernel), to help fix mistakes, and we actually know how the code works, now thats, thats not shit, thats a smart way of sharing load...dont cancel me on X...please...nor Grok,
Grok did nothing wrong
